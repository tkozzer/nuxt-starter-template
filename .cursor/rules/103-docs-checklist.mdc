## Checklist Maintenance Rules

- Always update checklists immediately after completing a task:
  - Check off the specific sub-item(s) completed
  - Keep parent items unchecked until all child items are done
  - Optionally add a brief note with concrete details (files touched, key choices like icons/colors, links)

- Modify checklists when new info appears:
  - Add new sub-items for additional scope or edge cases discovered
  - Update item text to reflect the actual implementation if it diverges from original plan
  - Keep notes concise and actionable; reference files and paths using backticks (e.g., `pages/index.vue`)

- Procedure after making code changes tied to a checklist:
  1. Edit the relevant `_docs/*checklist.md` and mark the item(s) as done
  2. Include a short note only if it improves clarity (1â€“2 lines)
  3. Run linters as usual; keep docs in sync with code changes
